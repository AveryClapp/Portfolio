<p>Hello! My name is Avery Clapp. As of writing this, I’m a junior at Johns
Hopkins University, studying Computer Science and Economics. My journey into
these fields began during the quarantine in 2020, when I discovered a keen
interest in Web3 technologies like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Initially, my
fascination was driven by their potential to make money.</p>
<p>Since then, my motivations have matured. Now, it’s the endless possibilities
of technology and its applications that excite me most. The challenge of solving
complex problems and continuously refining my skills is incredibly rewarding. I
believe Computer Science and its adjacent fields provide the perfect tools to
explore and create impactful solutions.</p>
<p>This blog will cover a broad range of topics, including coding frameworks,
technology trends, and other areas that spark my curiosity. Beyond tech, I’m
passionate about music (especially theory and guitar) and philosophy in its many
forms.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit! I hope you enjoy the posts I’ll be
sharing, and I look forward to exploring a variety of fascinating topics.</p>
