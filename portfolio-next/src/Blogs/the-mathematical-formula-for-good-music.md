### Why is Mozart a genius?

Growing up, I always wondered why society collectively classified the historical greats of music, specifically classical music, as geniuses. Some of the greats like Mozart, Beethoven, Bach are considered to be some of the smartest individuals in history, but why does the ability to compose and produce music grant the moniker of genius? This question plagued me for years, at least until I started playing the guitar.

In a spurt of boredom after my freshman year of college, I began to pick up the guitar. While at first the limiting factor was the physical aspect, like stretching my fingers to play a chord or figuring out how to press down hard enough, after some time the hard part became understanding the actual music. You see, after a certain point in playing the guitar^1[Pretty much as soon as you can reliably play a [barre chord](https://www.guitartricks.com/blog/Super-Easy-Barre-Chords-Explained)], most songs become playable. All that is really required is memorizing the chords and finger movements until you can replicate the noise. However, to me, this is an extremely shallow understanding of how to play the instrument and even just music in general. So I started to dive more into the theory behind the chords, scales, progressions, intervals, and more. During this escapade, I vividly remember watching an interview with John Mayer^2[If you're interested, check out the interview [here](https://johnmayer.info/posts/interview-bobby-bones-show)], where he detailed his thought process and what goes on in his mind while crafting a piece of music.

At this point, it started to be clear to me that great compositions of music were not just created by playing some notes and hoping they sounded good together, but rather through a precise and almost mathematical formula that relates notes, tones, meters and many more building blocks together in an optimal manner. So, the answer to my question had been answered, the greats of baroque, classical, and romantic era were geniuses because they understood the metagame of music, but what exactly is this mathematical formula that separates good music from great music?
