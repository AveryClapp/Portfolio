## The Genesis of Original Thought

I've always wondered: how do people create something from nothing? How did someone pioneer the idea of virtual memory? How do philosophical thinkers carve out completely different schools of thought? There's a common trope these days of people on the internet saying, 'I've never had a unique thought'. While certainly an overstatement, I definitely resonate with this. I mean, students have a hard enough time working through problem sets of solved math equations; it must be so much harder to derive that branch of math in the first place.

Are these pioneers fundamentally different from us? Do they possess some rare cognitive spark or some predisposition to truth? What if they were just lucky and they found themselves at the right place at the right time? The answer? Yes. Isaac Newton was definitely smarter than both of us and had a generational knack for scientific discovery. He lived in an era ripe for scientific revolution and stood on the shoulders of giants spearheading the next generation of mathematics. But that is not what made him great. What set Newton and his peers apart wasn't raw brainpower, it was their mastery over the basics: the first principles.

## Building Blocks

The first time I heard the term 'first principles', was this summer when I was reading [The Nicomachean Ethics](https://www.averyclapp.com/blog/the-nicomachean-ethics). A first principle is a foundational truth, an axiom upon which everything else is built. Of course, it seems like throughout all of my years at schooling this idea is drilled into our heads. Understanding the basics leads to understanding more advanced topics. However, it took me 22 years to realize that first principles are the building blocks of genius.

In Aristotle's own words, "A first principle is the first basis from which a thing is known.". These are stopping points. Ideas that are certain without proof^1[First principles do not need to be proven, or else that would cause an infinite regress of proofs]. There is no better field to portray this than mathematics. I'll give you five first principles and see how many propositions or ideas you can come up with that are founded upon these certainties:

1. A straight line can be drawn between any two points
1. A finite line can be extended infinitely
1. A circle can be drawn with any center and radius
1. All right angles are equal
1. If a line intersects two other lines such that interior angles sum to less than 180°, the lines will eventually intersect

Well, in his work, the _Elements_, Euclid derived 465 propositions from just these five identities. You'll notice that all of these are not extremely in-depth or esoteric, just obviously fundamental. This segues naturally into why first principled thinking is somewhat difficult. It is not because the ideas you are working with are extremely hard to reason about, but because it takes extreme understanding to connect them in nuanced ways. One of Euclid's propositions that you are familiar with is the **Pythagorean Theorem**. It took Euclid 46 intermediate steps starting from first principles to the famous $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ to rigorously prove the formula. That, I believe, is where intelligence comes into play. However, notice what kind of intelligence. Not memorization or pattern-matching, but the ability to see how simple truths combine in non-obvious ways. This is learnable through deep engagement with first principles, not an innate gift.

## Thinking from the Ground Up

I would argue, with my limited expertise in grappling with unsolved problems, that first principled thinking is the only way to pursue discovery. When we question our assumptions, break every single thought down to the most granular level, that is when progress can be made. It is when we find the stopping points of our ideas that we can build them back up like legos into something different and something new.

When Einstein started his work in physics, Newton's foundations were accepted as self-evident truths. Ideas like absolute time and space^2[Time flows uniformly everywhere, and space is a fixed reference frame] went unquestioned, even in the face of inconsistencies with empirical studies. Einstein went back to first principles and asked what he actually knew to be true: the laws of physics are the same in all reference frames, and the speed of light is constant for all observers. Working step by step from these foundations, he derived special relativity, where time dilates, space contracts, and simultaneity depends on your reference frame.

Medieval philosophy was built on three main pillars: aristotelian logic, scholastic methodology, and theological assumptions about god and the soul. From this level of abstraction, knowledge claims were justified in two ways: cite an authority, or fit observations into Aristotelian categories. That is, until a French philosopher named Réne Descartes questioned _everything_. In _Meditations_, Descartes proposed a new method for philosophy itself, all boiling down to one question: 'What can I know for absolute certainty?'. Stripping away our deceptive senses, and every other even slightly unstable assumption, Descartes argues we are left with the one first principle: **Cogito Ergo Sum - I think, therefore I am**.

The pattern is consistent across domains. Einstein and Descartes worked in radically different fields, yet their methodology was the same: identify assumptions, go back to what's actually known, rebuild from there. Discovery isn't the accumulation of facts within a paradigm; it's the creation of new paradigms. And you cannot create a framework while remaining inside another. First principles thinking makes those assumptions visible, allowing you to see what could be different.

This answers my original question: how do pioneers create something from nothing? They don't. They create from first principles, the basics. Newton wasn't just born with a gift for physics. He understood the axioms of force, motion, and mathematics so deeply that he saw connections everyone else missed. Einstein mastered the basics of mechanics so thoroughly that he saw through fake assumptions. Descartes understood epistemology so deeply he questioned what justification itself meant. The building blocks of genius aren't some rare cognitive spark or fortunate timing. They're mastery of first principles: the discipline of questioning assumptions and reasoning from bedrock. That's learnable.
