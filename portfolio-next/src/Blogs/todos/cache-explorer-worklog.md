title: "Cache Explorer: A Worklog"
date: ""
preview: "A deep dive into building an educational cache simulator that compiles user C/C++ code to LLVM IR and generates realistic memory access traces. Exploring the journey from basic IR parsing to handling complex address calculations and control flow. Diving into LLVM compiler infrastructure, getelementptr address computation, SSA form traversal, multi-level cache hierarchies with configurable associativity and replacement policies, and building visualization tools that reveal why cache-friendly code can outperform naive implementations by 10x despite identical algorithmic complexity."
