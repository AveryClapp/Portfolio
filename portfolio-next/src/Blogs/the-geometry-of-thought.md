preview: "How does our brain model thought? What shape does an idea take in the mind, and how do the paths between concepts define how we reason, learn, and create? In this post I explore a framework where cognition becomes a topological landscape, each mind a unique manifold shaped by experience, bias, and perspective. From curvature and symmetry to the intersections of individual and collective thought, we’ll map the invisible architecture of thinking itself."
