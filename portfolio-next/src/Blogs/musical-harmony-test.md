Pythagoras discovered that simple integer ratios sound harmonious. A perfect fifth is exactly 3:2. A perfect fourth is 4:3. These ratios minimize acoustic beating—it's physics, not preference.

But there's a problem.

If you tune a piano using perfect fifths (3:2 ratio), and go around the circle of fifths 12 times, you should return to where you started. Except $(3/2)^{12} \neq 2^7$. The "Pythagorean comma" is about 23 cents—noticeably out of tune.

## Why This Matters

Reality forces compromises that pure mathematics doesn't acknowledge. Perfect harmony exists in theory, not in instruments. Western music chose versatility (play in any key) over purity (perfect intervals).

This tradeoff appears everywhere: in engineering, in code, in life. You optimize for constraints—human fingers, instrument design, compositional freedom—not for mathematical ideals.

The piano is beautiful because it acknowledges its limitations.
