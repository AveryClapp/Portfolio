          Emergent Sparsity Matrix Multiplication (On-going)
        </h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
          Research project investigating how to exploit emergent sparsity patterns in large language models to accelerate inference. Exploring various techniques like dynamic masking, permutation invariants, and custom CUDA kernels to skip unnecessary computations during matrix multiplication, with the goal of achieving faster token generation without sacrificing model accuracy or quality.

          C++ Orderbook
        </h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
          A performance-critical C++ trading system designed for ultra-low latency order matching and execution. Built from scratch with extensive optimizations including memory pooling to eliminate syscalls, cache-friendly data structures, strategic struct alignment, branch prediction hints, and careful inlining. Achieved nearly 2M orders per second throughput by squeezing out every microsecond of performance through low-level systems programming techniques.

          Claude Code Fallback
        </h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
          An intelligent CLI wrapper for Claude Code that automatically switches from subscription to API billing when usage limits
          are hit. Built with Python using pseudo-terminals for seamless process interception, background thread monitoring for 
          real-time output parsing, and I/O handling. Maintains full terminal interactivity while transparently 
          detecting rate limit errors and orchestrating graceful process restarts with
          environment variable injection.
